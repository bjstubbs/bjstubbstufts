excerpt: 'Cumulative TSE from pregnancy to childhood is associated with dose- and duration-dependent decreases in child lung function at 6 years even in the absence of reported maternal smoking. Gestational vitamin D may modulate this effect and have therapeutic potential for minimizing the adverse effect of TSE on lung throughout early life'
