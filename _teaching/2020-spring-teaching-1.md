In this course we aim to:

1. Familiarize students with state-of-the-art tools for data science and big data, including advanced R, interactive data analysis with Shiny and plotly, NoSQL databases and tools such as MongoDB and Apache Drill, and Cloud Technologies

2. Teach best practices for data version management and outcome reproducibility using tools such as git, Travis CI, and computational notebooks

3. Have the students apply these skills to a real world data analysis project
